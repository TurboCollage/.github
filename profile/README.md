## üìå Overview

TurboCollage is a **macOS collage studio** that turns folders of photos into polished layouts‚Äî**grid, mosaic, zig-zag, scrapbook, irregular**, and more‚Äîready for print, social, or client delivery. Drag images in, shuffle with smart layout engines, fine-tune spacing, add text & stickers, and export crisp **PNG/JPEG/PDF/TIFF** at any size.

## ‚ùì What is TurboCollage?

**TurboCollage** is a purpose-built app for creating **beautiful, production-ready collages** without wrestling with a full-blown design suite. It‚Äôs built around three ideas:

1) **Instant layout** ‚Äî drop a batch of photos and get an attractive arrangement immediately. The app‚Äôs auto-engine balances aspect ratios, orientation, and visual weight so the collage feels intentional rather than random.  
2) **Fine control when you want it** ‚Äî every cell can be nudged, resized, rotated, swapped, or locked. Spacing, margins, roundness, shadows, and borders respond in real time, so you can iterate quickly until everything clicks.  
3) **True print/export freedom** ‚Äî set exact pixel, inch, or centimeter dimensions with DPI; add bleed; choose color profile; and export in formats suitable for **printers, labs, and online platforms**.

TurboCollage respects photo stories. Its smart shuffle avoids repeating faces side-by-side, preserves key subjects inside frames, and can apply auto-cropping that prioritizes faces and salient regions. For moodboards, scrapbooks, and event summaries, you can overlay **titles, captions, stickers, and color blocks**, then blend with textures or keep it clean and modern. For professionals, **templates** ensure a consistent look across multiple deliverables‚Äîthink photographers‚Äô proof sheets, brand moodboards, real-estate grids, or classroom/photo-booth strips.

Because collages often need to travel across media, TurboCollage supports **retina-quality exports**, **vector PDF**, and **high-DPI TIFF**. Social-ready presets (stories, posts, covers) coexist with print sizes (A4, Letter, 8√ó10, 16√ó20, 24√ó36). A single design can be resized responsively; the layout engine adapts cell geometry so your composition survives format changes with minimal tweaking. The end result is the same every time: **polished, balanced, and on-spec**.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About TurboCollage (Deep Dive)

TurboCollage focuses on **layout intelligence**. The engine models each photo‚Äôs dominant lines, face positions, and aspect ratio to place it in a cell that makes sense‚Äîportrait shots naturally find taller cells; wide landscapes prefer span cells; busy textures become background anchors. When you shuffle, the algorithm keeps global harmony while exploring new permutations, so you rarely fight the tool for a decent look.

The app offers distinct **layout modes**:

- **Regular Grid** ‚Äî equal cells, perfect for contact sheets and storefronts.  
- **Mosaic** ‚Äî varied cell sizes for visual rhythm; prioritize hero shots.  
- **Zig-Zag** ‚Äî staggered rows with pleasing diagonals (great for travel/storytelling).  
- **Scrapbook / Freeform** ‚Äî overlapping frames, rotations, tape/shadow effects.  
- **Photowall** ‚Äî edge-to-edge montage with minimal gaps.  
- **Shape Collage** ‚Äî fit photos into a heart, number, logo, or text silhouette.  
- **Jigsaw / Irregular** ‚Äî organic cells that feel hand-cut (with adjustable randomness).

Every mode exposes **pro-grade controls**: gap size, outer margin, per-cell border width & radius, inner shadow, drop shadow, global alignment, and snap strength. Backgrounds can be solid, gradient, image texture, or brand color; you can add **text boxes with typographic controls** (family, weight, tracking, line-height, alignment), and load **custom fonts** from macOS.

Workflow matters: batch add, drag to reorder, right-click to swap images between cells, **lock composition** while you swap photos, and use **Smart Replace** to preserve the grid while refreshing content. Color-aware guides help you pick borders that complement palette dominant colors. When exporting, save **recipes** (size, DPI, format, background, typography) to enforce team consistency.

For photographers, TurboCollage complements Lightroom/Photos: export selects, build a proof collage, send to a client, then regenerate at final resolution later. For marketers and teachers, it‚Äôs the fastest way to make **summaries, announcements, and posters** that look deliberately designed‚Äîwithout opening a heavy tool. And because it‚Äôs Mac-native, it‚Äôs **fast on Apple Silicon**, sips CPU when idle, and supports **drag & drop, Quick Look, and ColorSync**.

- For print labs, export **TIFF at 300 DPI** and embed the correct color profile.  
- Repurpose a design: resize to a new aspect‚Äîthen nudge a few cells to perfect it.  
- Use a **subtle border** (1‚Äì3 px) to separate similar-toned images.  
- Keep hero shots larger; let textures fill connective cells for visual pacing.
